      "For nonlinear systems of hyperbolic PDEs, like the Euler equations that well study in [Lesson 4](Lesson_04_Fluid_dynamics.ipynb), the solution of the Riemann problem can be quite complicated.  Computational methods for solving such systems are usually based on approximate Riemann solvers.  We won't go into the theory of Riemann problems or approximate Riemann solvers in this course."
